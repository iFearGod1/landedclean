# Landed Clean

An independent studio focused on long-term ownership of durable digital assets.

## Purpose
This repository powers the public landing site for Landed Clean.

The site is intentionally:
- Minimal
- Static
- Calm
- Professional

This is not a web app, not a SaaS, and not a dashboard.
No backend, no authentication, no database.

## Visual Direction

Primary palette:
- Deep brown: #755540
- Warm tan: #D2B48C

Design rules:
- The palette should feel creamy, warm, and blended.
- Avoid sharp transitions between tan and brown.
- Prefer soft gradients, overlays, or subtle fades where these colors meet.
- Brown should feel grounded, not heavy.
- Tan should feel warm and soft, not bright or stark.

Recommended usage:
- Backgrounds: light tan or off-white derived from #D2B48C
- Text / accents: deep brown #755540
- Sections: use gentle gradient transitions from tan → brown rather than hard color breaks

Overall tone:
- Calm
- Natural
- Quietly confident
- No high-contrast or aggressive color usage

## Content Guidelines
- Keep copy short and neutral
- Avoid marketing language
- Avoid buzzwords
- Focus on ownership, durability, and clarity

## Technical Constraints
- Next.js (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Static site only
- Deployed on Vercel
- No backend
- No database
- No authentication

## Agent Instructions
This repository is intended to be modified by an automated agent.

When making changes:
- Prefer simplicity over features
- Ship a single, durable landing page
- Do not introduce unnecessary dependencies
- Ensure the site builds successfully before committing
